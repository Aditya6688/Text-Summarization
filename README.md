Overview
This repository implements a text summarization system using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The project focuses on generating concise and coherent summaries from large text documents by leveraging the power of transformer-based language models.

Features
Preprocessing of textual data for summarization tasks.
Fine-tuning BERT models for extractive or abstractive summarization.
Evaluation of summarization results using ROUGE metrics.
Implementation of a user-friendly interface for testing summaries.
Pre-trained BERT models with support for Hugging Face Transformers.
